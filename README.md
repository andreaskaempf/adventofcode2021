Advent of Code 2021

This repository contains my entries for the Advent of Code 2021.

* **Day 1** (C, Python): Count number of increases in a text file of lines
* **Day 2** (Go, Python): Process the state of a submarine by interpreting 
    instructions "forward", "up", "down", etc.
* **Day 3** (Julia, Python): Read list of binary numbers to establish 
    codes based on column-wise bit frequency
* **Day 4** (Go): Simulate game of bingo, by applying list of called numbers
    until first board wins (for part 2, also find the last board
    that wins)
* **Day 5** (Go): Trace lines on a grid, given starting and ending 
    coordinates of each line, and count up where 2 or more lines cross 
    (part 1 only includes horizontal and vertical lines, part 2 diagonal 
    as well).

* gcc day01.c -o day01
* ./day01

To compile and run a Go program
* Change into the directory with the program
* go build day02.go
* ./day02

To run a Julia program
